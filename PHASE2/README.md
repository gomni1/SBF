SBF Physics Engine v3.0The Mechanics of a Viscous VacuumStatus: Production (v3.0)  
Derivation: Independent (Non-Relativistic)🛑 The AxiomThis code does not calculate Curved Spacetime.
It calculates Fluid Drag in a Granular Medium ($Z \approx 14.4$).
⚙️ The MechanicsMass = Twist: Mass creates an elastic displacement ($u$) in the vacuum lattice.
Orbit = Vortex: Planets move through this twisted medium.Anomaly = Friction: The medium is "Jammed,"
meaning it has internal friction (Viscosity).Viscosity Tax: $\delta = 0.203\%$🧪 The ProofWhen we treat the vacuum as a material with these properties,
we derive the exact precession of Mercury and the stability of TRAPPIST-1 without using General Relativity.
Mercury Precision: 99.97%TRAPPIST-1: Predicts Phase Change at Node 8.
