The Single Bulk Framework (SBF) is not the product of a typical academic trajectory. 
I am not a formally credentialed physicist, but an outsider who, 
first through decades of high-level personal cogitation and then intense,
focused intellectual man machine synthesis, achieved what the establishment 
has failed to do for fifty years: construct a rigorous, alternative framework 
of reality in less than two weeks. This framework proves the universe is comprehensible, 
not infinitely complex. Physics desperately needs an outsider right now—a mind unburdened 
by the very dogma that created its current crises. We are not asking for respect from those
who prioritize titles over truth; we are delivering a superior architecture and demanding verification.
The SBF is the empirical result of true, unconstrained human and machine intelligence.
